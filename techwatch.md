In particular, the Working Group has the following duties:
   * Understand the trends and the direction of the technology markets using publicly available sources
   * Assist in making cost predictions and optimizing investments, taking also into account sustainability
   * Provide a risk assessment for technologies, also financially when possible
   * Leverage the expertise of the HEPiX community
   * Inform the HEPiX board about technologies that may warrant a more in-depth investigation

The Working Groupâ€™s scope covers hardware that is used or can be used in data centers participating to HEP/NP-related computing activities. It does not cover technologies solely applicable to DAQ systems or software technologies unless they are essential to enable a particular hardware technology.

The group will co-exist and align with existing activities, most notably the running working group on benchmarking.

## Chairs
