# Technology Watch Working Group

The mandate of this Working Group is to monitor the relevant
evolutions, both in terms of technology and markets, of the computing
equipment that are relevant to the HEPiX community. The group will co-exist and align with existing
activities, most notably the running working groups on benchmarking
and cost modelling.

## Chairs

The group is jointly chaired by **Helge Meinhard** (Helge dot Meinhard at cern dot ch) and **Bernd Panzer-Steindel** (Bernd Panzer-Steindel at cern dot ch).
