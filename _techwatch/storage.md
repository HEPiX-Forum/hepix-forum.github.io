## Proposed Storage Areas

The following are the proposed areas within the Storage sub-WG:

   * HDD
   * SDD
   * NVM(?)
   * Disk storage infrastructure (servers, interconnects, etc) (?)
   * Tape (and associated infrastructure)
   * Others (optical, etc)
   * Cloud storage (?)


## Structure for each of the above-mentioned areas:

   * Current technology specs, status and outlook
      * capacity, density, sequential and random I/O performance
      * reliability and required/possible redundancy levels
      * lifetime
      * relevance to HEP use cases
   * Market status and outlook
      * % market, units/PB shipped, annual growth rate
      * pricing evolution, (discount rates)
      * vendors and their status and market share, sales, net revenues
      * Impact on HEP
   * Comparisons within same area
      * eg. HAMR vs MAMR
   * Comparisons across areas (disk vs SSD vs tape vs...)
      * [this section needs then to be consolidated across all areas]
   * Relevant Documentation links
      * References, specs, news and rumour pages, etc
