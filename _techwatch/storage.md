## Storage Areas

The following are the areas within the Storage sub-WG:

   * Hard Disks (HDDs)
   * Solid-State Disks (SDDs)
   * Storage Class Memory
   * Storage infrastructure
   * Tape
   * Others (optical, holographic, etc)

## Structure for each of the areas:

   * Technology specifications, status and outlook
      * capacity, density, sequential and random I/O performance
      * reliability and required/possible redundancy levels
      * lifetime
      * relevance to HEP use cases
      * comparisons within same area (e.g. HAMR vs MAMR)
   * Market status and outlook
      * % market, units/PB shipped, annual growth rate
      * pricing evolution, (discount rates)
      * vendors and their status and market share, sales, net revenues
      * impact on HEP
   * Comparisons
      * e.g. disk vs SSD vs tape vs... [this section needs then to be consolidated across all areas]
      * comparison (in particular wrt cost) to Cloud based Storage
   * Documentation
      * relevant documentation links: references, specs, news and rumour pages, etc
