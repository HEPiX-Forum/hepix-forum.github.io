This document provides instructions on how to execute the HEPScore23 benchmark.

## Requirements

It is crucial that the server is fully dedicated to the benchmarking activity during the run, to ensure accurate measurements and prevent potential errors.

The server must have a minimum hardware configuration (see requirements below) and include the following packages:
   * Container engine Apptainer (version 1.1.6 or higher);
   * Python version 3.9 or higher;
   * python3-pip;
   * git

The user will need pip and git to install HEPScore23 as a Python package.

Hardware requirements:
   * A disk space proportional to the number of available cores on the server (about 1 GB per logical core) is necessary to temporarily store the results;
   * The server must have at least 2GB of RAM per logical core;
   * ulimit configuration (see details below)



## Run the HEP Benchmark Suite

While it is possible to install HEPScore23 standalone (see later), it is recommended to use the HEP Benchmark Suite alongside HEPScore23 to include in the benchmark report metadata about the server's running conditions. The metadata includes details about the server's CPU, RAM, disks, IP addresses, and other relevant information. In future versions of the suite, there will be the capability to configure additional measurement plugins, expanding the functionality beyond its current state. These new plugins will include options such as an energy consumption plugin or a load and memory usage plugin.

The HEP Benchmark Suite can be installed using pip and git.

A [bash script](https://gitlab.cern.ch/hep-benchmarks/hep-benchmark-suite/-/raw/master/examples/hepscore/run_HEPscore.sh) has been developed  to streamline the installation and running process. This script provides a fully comprehensive running procedure and enables the system administrator to install the HEP Benchmark Suite and HEPScore23, run the HEP Benchmark Suite, which in turn extracts the necessary metadata from the server, executes HEPScore23 and produces a final output document. 

#### Script mandatory parameters
To use the bash script, users will need to provide a mandatory custom parameter to declare the specific site on which the benchmark is running. 

The **SITE** parameter is essential for ensuring that the results are accurately attributed to the correct site when integrated into the WLCG Benchmark DB.
If the "SITE" parameter cannot be assigned or the user opts not to declare it, a dummy value like "dummy" or "anonymous" should be used as a placeholder. These placeholder values avoid that the script raises exceptions, and allow, in case of publication, for the integration of data into the database while indicating that the site information is intentionally omitted.

To run the script, users can use the following command line. 
```sh
./run_HEPscore.sh -s SITE 
```

By default, the script will use the current directory to create a working directory where all necessary files will be stored, including container images, benchmark outputs, and temporary workload results. The working directory can be modified using the parameter **-w target_folder**.

During the execution the script reports the stdout of the HEP Benchmark Suite. If the execution completes successfully, it will print at the end information such as

{% raw %}
[INFO] Successfully completed all requested benchmarks<br>
=========================================================<br>
BENCHMARK RESULTS FOR \<hostname\><br>
=========================================================<br>
Suite start: *start_date*<br>
Suite end:   *end_date*<br>
Machine CPU Model: *name*<br>
HEPscore Benchmark = *value*<br>
{% endraw %}

Using the bash script ensures that the entire process is performed correctly, and it is recommended that users utilize it when installing and running HEPScore23.


### Publish results (Optional)
The HEP Benchmark Suite also offers the added benefit of being able to submit the benchmark results to the WLCG Benchmark DB (based on OpenSearch/ElasticSearch). To accomplish this, a valid X509 certificate (service, robot, user) must be available, and the certificate's DN must be authorized for the publication of the results.

The command line options of the script will include the **-p** (publish) argument, as well as the mandatory certificate and key file location. 

To run the script, users can use the following command line. 
```sh
./run_HEPscore.sh -s SITE -p -c /path/to/cert.pem -k /path/to/key.pem
```


To declare the DN users should open a [GGUS tickets](https://ggus.eu/?mode=ticket_submit).  For additional information please refer to the below [section](#how-to-open-a-ggus-ticket).


#### DN extraction
To extract the DN from the certificate  run:

```sh
openssl x509 -noout -in user.crt.pem -subject -nameopt RFC2253
```

which should output something similar to:
```
subject=CN=Name Surname,CN=123456,CN=username,OU=Users,OU=Organic Units,DC=cern,DC=ch
```


## Run HEPScore23 standalone

If the usage of the HEP Benchmark Suite and the orchestrator [bash script](https://gitlab.cern.ch/hep-benchmarks/hep-benchmark-suite/-/raw/master/examples/hepscore/run_HEPscore.sh) is not an option for you, the following instructions will allow the installation of the python package of HEPScore23.
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to install HEPScore23.

```sh
python3 -m venv HS23env
source HS23env/bin/activate
pip3 install  git+https://gitlab.cern.ch/hep-benchmarks/hep-score.git@v1.5
```
 
* to access the help menu 
```sh
hepscore -h
```

* to dump the HEPScore23 configuration 
```sh
hepscore -p
 ```

* to run
```sh
hepscore -v /path/to/workdir
 ```
 
## How to open a GGUS ticket

If assistance is needed, the support unit of HEPscore can be reached via [GGUS tickets](https://ggus.eu/?mode=ticket_submit). 
In that case the *Type of Issue* and the *Support Unit* to be selected is Benchmarking, as in the screenshot here:

## Troubleshooting
### ulimit configuration on CENTOS7 (reason and procedure)
A workload of the HEPScore23 benchmark uses a multi-service approach for the reconstruction and starts multiple processes per core that stay idle waiting for their turn of processing. For machines with more than 100 CPU cores, this translates into more than 4096 processes, which is the default for normal (non-root) users on CentOS7. Therefore, HEPScore23 should run as root, or the user should be able to start more processes. This can be set with ulimit on CentOS7 by adding the line

```sh
echo "benchmark  soft nproc unlimited" >> /etc/security/limits.d/20-nproc.conf 
```

It is necessary to start a new shell session after that change before running HEPScore23.

### CVMFS (as image repository) configuration 
Although itâ€™s not part of the standard configuration, it is possible to get the container images for the benchmark from CVMFS instead of from the gitlab registry. Some workloads of the HEPScore23 benchmark access several files in parallel on /cvmfs, about 200 files per CPU core. For bigger machines (more than 60 cores), it is necessary to adjust the CVMFS config and set the maximal number of open files (CVMFS_NFILES in /etc/cvmfs/default.local) value to about 200 times the number of cores. The new value is active after a remount of the CVMFS repository on the machine.
